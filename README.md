**IMPORTANT**<br>
Due to the CORS policy of most modern web-browsers, the game will not run. To run correctly, you must install and run a server such as a WAMP server like Uniform Server.<br>

**Objective**<br>
Shoot the box targets as they appear above you. Watch your aim as the tank shells you fire are
projectile based, so you will have to account for the drop of the shell as it travels!
